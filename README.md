# GOAP AI

GOAP AI is a project with the goal of implementing an AI with GOAP theory. The AI is placed in a dungeon that has different zones, enemies, civilians, pick ups and bosses in a room that is opened with a specific hidden key.

Without knowing what the dungeon is like and exploring it as it moves, it will have to fulfill the objective that we set it, either killing all the bosses or rescuing all the hostages.
